# django-react
fully fledged ecommerce
# Premise
I decided to try combine Django as a backend and React as a frontend, so I started looking for methods and I found a good course by Dennis Ivy. He helped me understand many concepts of full-stack development.
# Purpose
To create fully functional e-commerce site with PostgreSql for database.
